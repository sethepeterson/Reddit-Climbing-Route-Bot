>>Hanging Judge escapes left from the route The Great Escape. Clip two of the same bolts before heading into a long left reach to jugs and fun, thuggy moves pulling over the lip. This is a nice taste of Justice. It has good rock, good moves, and is a bit longer than Officer Friendly, but it is still a short route.

Above is an example of a generate comment. 94 comments have been posted as of May 2019. Route identification accuracy on those comments is ~95%.
</br>This can definitely be improved, as well as number of comments posted.
Only sumbmissions with titles fitting a generic format are considered at the moment.
Broadening the scope of the format is a potential improvement, as the nature of reddit submission titles is diverse.
