>>Hanging Judge escapes left from the route The Great Escape. Clip two of the same bolts before heading into a long left reach to jugs and fun, thuggy moves pulling over the lip. This is a nice taste of Justice. It has good rock, good moves, and is a bit longer than Officer Friendly, but it is still a short route.

>>Per Jeff Welch: "5 bolts, fixed draws on all, and fixed lowering biners at the anchors above the lip."

Above is an example of a generated comment. 94 comments have been posted as of May 2019. Route identification accuracy on those comments is ~95%.
</br>This can definitely be improved, as well as the volume of comments posted.
Only sumbmissions with titles fitting a generic format are considered at the moment.
Broadening the scope of the format is a needed improvement, but will be difficult because Reddit's submission titles tend to be diverse.

## Execution
To execute the script you must [sign up](https://www.reddit.com/prefs/apps "Sign up for Reddit API account") for a Reddit API account.
Then create a text file that holds the API account credentials.
The text file must be located at the following path (which is relative to rClimbingBot.py):
> \\..\\..\\ClimbingRouteBotInfo.txt

The file must be in the format:
> <1> <2> <3> <4> <5>


</br> With the passholders replaced in this order:
1. client ID
2. client secret
3. username
4. password
5. user agent

Example:

> LVpgepkZY8W9kb 834ts3692jIxsRQO0_qH_Vq6zeG20 YourUserName YourPassword YourUserAgent

After this is completed, execute rClimbingBot.py.
